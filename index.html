            <p>My name is Cale Moore and I've been a resident of Springfield, Missouri basically my whole life. I'm currently a student at the Springfield campus of Ozarks Techincal Comunity College where I'm studying computer science. I currently live with my parents and girlfriend but I'm hoping to move out when the housing market is more affordable. I'm a bit of an introvert so I'm very quite and keep to myself but once I get comfortable with people I tend to talk all the time. I'm great working both by myself and in teams. I've always been very creative and I love to think of clever ways to solve problems, so I suppose I was destined for computer science.
            </p>

            <p>I attended Willard High School (WHS) where I was a part of a lot of the extracuricular activities that were offered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marching Band</li>
                <li>Jazz Band</li>
                <li>Concert Band</li>
                <li>The fall musical</li>
                <li>Children's Thespians (performing specifically for younger audiences)</li>
                <li>Archery</li>
                <li>Science Olympiad</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My many extracuricular excapades taught me many valuble skills. Archery taught me how to calm myself under pressure, Science Olympiad gave me preperation and time manegment skills, and Band also helped with time manegment, as wells as teach me to how to take orders. Theater helped me learn to think outside of the box.</p>

        <div id="accomplishments">
            <h2>-- Accomplishments --</h2>
            <p>I've accomplished many things over the years. In Jazz Band I won the outstanding musician ship award three years in a row, and in archery I shot a perfect 50/50 and had a record of 281/300 for a total score. My friend and I medaled at Science Olympiad Regionals our senior year, taking 5th place in Ecology. Sadly, I don't have any notable accomplishments within the world of computer science yet.</p>
