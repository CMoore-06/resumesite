        <h2>-- Previous Projects --</h2>
        <p>This page has links to all of my previous website development projects. Feel free to look around and inspect them. All exept a labeled few were made as assignments for college, and have been left unaltered so that you can see how my webiste development skills have grown.</p>

        <h2>-- Non-Responsive Projects --</h2>
        <p>These projects are ones that I recomend you view on desktop. I created these before I learned about making websites responsive so they don't work very well on moble screens.</p>

        <div id="first-row">
            <div id="about-me-website" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/about-me-website/index.html>" target="blank"><img src="images/about-me.png" alt="Me during my senior year Jazz concert"></a>

                <h3>About Me Website</h3>
               
                <p>This site was the first one I ever made. The entire website is just an introduction to myself. I even linked a project I made in my highschool web dev class.</p>
            </div>  
            
            <div id="about-a-company" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/about_a_company/index.html" target="blank"><img src="images/about-a-company.png" alt="The logo for the Monster Hunter video game franchise."></a>

                <h3>About A Company</h3>

                <p>This was the second project I made. Its purpose was to show off the skills we had with HTML and CSS at the beginning of the year. I made mine surrounding my favorite video game franchise, Monster Hunter.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="bnb" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/bed-and-breakfast/index.html" target="blank"><img src="images/bnb.png" alt="A picture of a victorian house which served as the venue for my fictional Bed and Breakfast."></a>

                <h3>Bed and Breakfast</h3>

                <p>This website was the last one we created before we learned how to make them responsive. Its main purpose was to show our skills at basic CSS (no flexbox or grid), and our understanding of making forms in HTML. The assignment was to create a fictional bed and breakfast. I decided to base mine off of the one from CBS's series Ghosts.</p>

                <p class="disclaimer">*It looks a little wonky because I had to mess with the CSS to make all of the pictures display correctly and I haven't fixed it yet.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>-- Responsive Projects --</h2>
        <p>These are the projects I made that are actually responsive and look good on moble screens.</p>

        <div id="second-row">
            <div id="funyon" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/The-Funyon/index.html" target="blank"><img src="images/the-funyon.png" alt="The logo for The Funyon, a fictional news site I made."></a>

                <h3>The Funyon</h3>

                <p>This site was made to show our understanding of website responsiveness. This is the very first responsive site I ever made. The entire concept of it is a spoof of The Onion.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="fit-for-fitness" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/fit-for-fitness/index.html" target="blank"><img src="images/fit-for-fitness.png" alt="The logo for my fictional gym, Fit For Fitness."></a>

                <h3>Fit For Fitness</h3>

                <p>This site was the second responive site I made. Its purpose was to show our understanding of making websites responive. So using media queries to move things around so to make the website look good no matter how big the screen is.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="pawfect-pet-care" class="card">
                <a href="webprojects/pawfect-pet-care/index.html" target="blank"><img src="images/pawfect-pet-care.png" alt="A picture of the interior of my fictional pet grooming service Pawfect Pet Care."></a>

                <h3>Pawfect Pet Care</h3>

                <p>This website is a site for a fictional pet grooming/daycare/boarding service called Pawfect Pet Care. The purpose of the site was to show our understanding of how to use bootstrap, along with CSS flexbox.</p>
